# parallel-sph-algorithm

Parallel implementation of the [Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) developed for the High Performance Computing programming project (Academic Year 2022/2023).

Parallel version of MÃ¼ller's "Particle-Based Fluid Simulation for Interactive Applications".

[Repo](https://github.com/cerrno/mueller-sph)

It offers:

- [x] [Serial implementation](https://github.com/LorenzoDrudi/parallel-sph-algorithm/blob/master/src/sph.c) 
- [x] [GUI serial implementation](https://github.com/LorenzoDrudi/parallel-sph-algorithm/blob/master/src/sph.c)
- [x] [OpenMP implementation](https://github.com/LorenzoDrudi/parallel-sph-algorithm/blob/master/src/omp-sph.c)
- [x] [MPI implementation](https://github.com/LorenzoDrudi/parallel-sph-algorithm/blob/master/src/mpi-sph.c)

### How to Compile

**Run all the commands in the src folder**.

- ```make all```: builds all the versions (default)
- ```make serial```: builds the non-GUI serial version
- ```make serial```: builds the GUI serial version
- ```make omp```: builds the omp version 
- ```make mpi```: builds the mpi version
- ```make clean ```: clean up executables (NOT stats files)

### How to Run

`Max input size`: 20000. \
`Default params`: Particles: 500, Steps: 50.

- *Serial*: ```sph ${INPUT_SIZE} ${NUM_STEPS}``` \
  (e.g. ```sph 500``` to run with 500 particles and 50 steps)
- *GUI*: ```sph.gui ${INPUT_SIZE}``` \
  (e.g. ```sph.gui 500``` to run with 500 particles)
- *OpenMP*: ```OMP_NUM_THREADS=${NUM_THREADS} omp-sph ${NUM_PARTICLES} ${NUM_STEPS}``` \
  (e.g. ```OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 omp-sph 500``` to run with 4 threads, 500 particles and 50 steps)
- *MPI*: ```mpirun -n ${NUM_CORES} mpi-sph ${NUM_PARTICLES} ${NUM_STEPS}``` \
  (e.g. ```mpirun -n 4 mpi-sph 500``` to run with 4 cores, 500 particles and 50 steps)
  
  
### Stats

**Stats files are added into the stats folder**
  
- ```make stats```: builds all and run the stats scripts (see [scripts](https://github.com/LorenzoDrudi/parallel-sph-algorithm/blob/master/script) folder)
- ```make clean-stats```: clean up stats files

Scripts:
- [omp-stats](https://github.com/LorenzoDrudi/parallel-sph-algorithm/blob/master/script/omp-stats.sh)
- [mpi-stats](https://github.com/LorenzoDrudi/parallel-sph-algorithm/blob/master/script/mpi-stats.sh) 

Each script executes the program several times increasing the number of threads/cores from 1 to the number available on your machine.
Each execution is repeated 5 times.
The cycle is done two times:
1. The input size remains constant and the number of threads/cores increases. Execution
   times are useful to get speedup and strong scaling efficiency;
2. The amount of work done by each thread/core remain constant. The execution times are useful 
   to get weak scaling efficiency.
